# ChromeCoursePlanner

This is a tool to automatically register UT students for their courses. Using this chrome extension, students may enter the course codes they'd like to register for (as well as waitlisting and alternatives) and their registration time - when this time comes, they will automatically be registered as described.

Components of this project include javascript logic to register for courses, an intuitive table to specify ideal courses as well as waitlisting and alternate course preference, and finally the logic to run everything at the correct time and return to the user a log of what happened.
